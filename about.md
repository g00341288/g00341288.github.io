I am currently completing a _BSc in Web Technologies and Programming_ at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), in Galway, Ireland. I have also completed degrees in Sociology and Philosophy at University College Cork, and I have a professional background in higher education and institutional research. I learned to code while I was a research analyst for Postsecondary Analytics, LLC in Florida, where I wrote short ad hoc scripts in Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, and R to solve a variety of everyday business problems, reduce research costs, and prototype bespoke data visualisations for a range of clients from small private postsecondary institutions and non-profits to interstate commissions and national higher education associations.
