description: 		"AJAX is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page. In this lab, HTML data will be requested from a server and added to a web page. You will need to have access to a web server to complete this lab. If you have apache, IIS, or some other web server available on your device, then use that. Maybe you have WAMP, MAMP, LAMP or XAMPP installed on your device, which includes the apache web server. If you are unsure about using a web server then ask your lecturer. Alternatively, you could amend your browser to allow it access to your local file system if you do not have a server available. However, this is not recommended for security reasons, but for the duration of the lab, this option could be enabled. Discuss this with your lecturer if this is an option you wish to proceed with."
