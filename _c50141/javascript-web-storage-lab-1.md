description: 		"In this exercise you will be required to create an object many times. Each instance of the object will be stored locally initially and then stored by the web session. The object will be converted to JSON format, before adding it to storage. Once the objects are stored, then they will need to be accessed. This will involve using the JSON object to convert the JSON formatted stored value to a JavaScript object. At this point, the object property for each instance can be checked to verify the expected objects were held in storage."
