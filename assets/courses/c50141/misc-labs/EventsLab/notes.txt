Events

What is an event?
Events, in the context of the browser, relate to the web API which represents events in the familiar sense of the browser and DOM. They include mousedown, mouseup, page load, and so on. 

Event Handlers: How JS code is triggered by events

Binding an event to an element: 
HTML event handler attributes / example: <input type="text" id="username" onblure="checkUserName()"> [don't use, not popular]
Traditional DOM event handlers / example: el.onblur = checkUsername(); [disadvantage - one function per event]
DOM level 2 event listeners / el.addEventListener('blur', checkUsername, false); [best practice]
                                                                |           |
                                                         no parentheses   determines event flow

Event Flow
Nested elements nested event flow
Event bubbling events flow up
Event capturing events flow down
This matters when an element and its descendents/ancestors also have handlers
