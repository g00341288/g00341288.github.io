Website for BSc in Web Technologies and Programming (Student #: G00341288)

## Description
This Git repository contains the source code for the module lab website required by the 
Web Application Development module of the BSc in Web Technologies and Programming at GMIT (2016).
The source code for module labs may be found in: 

`assets/courses/c50141`

Jekyll resources used to build the site may be found variously distributed over the following directories: 

`_c50135`
`_c50138`
`_c50141`
`_c50144`
`_includes`
`_layouts`
`_posts`
`_sass`
`_site`
`assets`
`blog`
`css`
`js`
`vendor`

Site source code comprises markdown files, Liquid templates, and html partials chiefly, which the Jekyll 
parsing engine uses to build a static site which can then be served on Github pages (or local with the right
development environment).

## Getting started 
You can clone the repository and see it in action locally but there are some development environment requirements
to be satisfied first. Jekyll requires: 

* Ruby
* RubyGems
* Python 2.7
* NodeJS

Detailed instructions may be found on the installation procedure [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and 
[here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation). 

If you already have a suitable development environment, you can fire up the site with the following command: 

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
