### Web Application Development 

Welcome to the {{ page.title }} page. Below you will find links to the associated repo and demonstrations where applicable. In the left sidebar (Source) you will find a link to the git repo associated with the site itself which also contains the source code for the module labs. The site was built with Jekyll Generic, a Generic Jekyll Bootstrap starter project I built specifically to support this project which provides a base for building websites and/or blogs with the Jekyll static blog generator. Jekyll is, essentially, a parsing engine. It permits the developer to build sites using dynamic components such as Liquid templates, partials, and markdown, which it uses to generate static sites.
