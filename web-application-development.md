### Web Application Development 

Welcome to the {{ page.title }} page. Below you will find links to labs associated with the course. In the left sidebar (Source) you will find a link to a git repo that contains all of the source code for the module labs.
In the table on the right you will find brief descriptions and links to demos of the associated code. Some of the demos are not, strictly speaking, functional. PHP lab content cannot be served from Github pages, which hosts this site. Any lab that is not currently functioning on Github pages should include a brief README.md file to signal this.
